#### <font color="#067ac5">Important! </font>
You need to be on your development computer. This assignment is not meant to be solved in the browser.

#### <font color="#067ac5">Estimated Time Commitment</font>

You should allocate between 20 to 30 minutes for this test - which includes installation, testing, and submission. 

#### <font color="#067ac5">Technology Stack</font>

Front-end (JavaScript, CSS, HTML).


#### <font color="#067ac5">Before starting the test</font>

You need to be on your development computer for this test. This is not a coding challenge in the browser.


#### <font color="#067ac5">Problem Statement in brief</font>

You’re provided with a front-end app based on HTML/CSS/JavaScript with one feature that are partially implemented

* Feature 1: Initial listing. The initial page is meant to display PaymentMethod companys in a list. You need to retrieve this from the server. 

The exact tasks are specified in the issue list in the GitHub project.


#### <font color="#067ac5">Two steps for project submission</font>

* First you commit your completed code to GitHub. You do not have to email zipped files or send your code in any other way. 
* Click the Submit button in blue on <b>J</b>ustcode's assignment page
* You can commit/submit as many times as you want for as long as the test is active

#### <font color="#067ac5">Project Evaluation and Scoring</font>

Your submission is evaluated based on four primary criteria

* Implementation of features as explained in the GitHub issue list. These are evaluated using unit tests for testing JavaScript.
* Best practices related to clean code, appropriate error handling, writing safe code. We understand that there are multiple approaches to this so do what you think is appropriate.
* When you close issues, please add some helpful comments. That’ll give the employer a better idea of your thought process. 
* Your employer is likely to manually review your source code.

#### <font color="#067ac5">Ready to start?</font>

If you're ready to get started, go ahead with the rest of the steps explained below.

#### <font color="#067ac5">Important!</font>
You need to clone the repo, not download zip and you need to submit your project to the employer by committing your code to GitHub back to this repository. (You are NOT emailing a zip file with your solution by email)


#### <font color="#067ac5">Prerequisites</font>

* We recommend using a modern web browser which supports serving `HTML/CSS/JavaScript` as files from the file system.
* You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and yarn>= 1.6.0 or npm >= 5.6 on your machine.

#### <font color="#067ac5">Server setup</font>

* You should run the web application before proceeding further. Let's say you cloned the project and you get a directory such as `C:\Users\james\assignment\testtakehome_javascript_countries-T1218-A583-R84`

* Inside that directory, you should see a folder `src`
* cd to that folder.
* run `npm` or `npm install`.

Right click on `index.html` to view it in the browser.


#### <font color="#067ac5">Is the assignment app running?</font>

If it runs, you should see the PaymentMethod page but without any records. That's what you'll work on in the assignments below. Now you can go to the GitHub issues and start knocking them down!
